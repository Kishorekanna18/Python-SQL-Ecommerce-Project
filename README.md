**Python and SQL E-commerce Project**  
In this project, I developed a comprehensive e-commerce data management and analysis system using Python and SQL. The project involved designing a relational database schema for storing customer information, product details, transactions, and order history. Python was used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, as well as for implementing data analysis algorithms to uncover patterns in customer behavior and sales trends. The system enabled efficient querying, reporting, and visualization of key performance metrics, helping to optimize inventory management, improve customer targeting, and drive business growth.
